# Environment: PRODUCTION (AWS)
# For production, secrets should be stored in AWS Secrets Manager

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
SECRET_NAME=my-money-backend-secrets

# For local development with AWS, set:
NODE_ENV=production

# Production Secrets (should be set in AWS Secrets Manager, not here!)
# Database credentials managed by RDS. JWT_SECRET set as direct env var.
# To create RDS-managed secrets, use a JSON object like:
# {
#   "host": "my-money-db.cluster-xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
#   "username": "admin_generated",
#   "password": "auto-generated-password-123",
#   "port": "5432",
#   "database": "myapp_production"
# }

# Environment variables (set these in your AWS console/ECS task definition):
# Secrets Manager (RDS-generated): DB components (host, username, password, port, database)
# Direct environment vars: JWT_SECRET, PORT, AWS_REGION, SECRET_NAME, FRONTEND_URL

# Note: JWT_SECRET is now a direct environment variable (set once, never changes)
# Database credentials are managed and rotated automatically by RDS

# Example environment variables in ECS:
JWT_SECRET=your-static-jwt-secret-here
PORT=8080
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
SECRET_NAME=my-money-backend-secrets

# CORS Configuration
FRONTEND_URL="https://your-frontend-domain.com,https://www.your-domain.com"
